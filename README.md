# Project Scope.

 Hypotheses: We will build a deep neural network that can recognize images, while explaining the techniques used throughout the process.
 We’re going to teach the computer to recognize images and classify them into categories. We’re going to use Python and Keras to write the program.
 To do so, we first need to teach the computer how a cat, a dog, a bird, etc. look like before it being able to recognize a new object (supervised learnning).
 Also, we'll be using Flask and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap to create web page; where users will be able enter a link of a desire image, execute the program that will reconize and classify the image.
